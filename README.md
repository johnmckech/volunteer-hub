# volunteer-hub

Volunteer-Hub is a full-deck project that connects volunteers with opportunities within their communities. The user simply provides basic information about their qualifications and ideal time commitment before being directed to several opportunities that meet their criteria. This way, the user can find an opportunity that matches their specifications and the volunteering service can have an influx of ideal candidates.
